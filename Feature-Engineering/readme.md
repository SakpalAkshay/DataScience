A directory to record information realted to use of feature engineering in Machine Learning

## Defination 

Feature engineering is a preprocessing step in statistical modeling and supervised machine learning that transforms raw data into a more effective set of inputs. The goal of feature engineering is to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by selecting and transforming the most relevant variables from raw data.
