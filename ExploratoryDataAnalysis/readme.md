# EDA Terminologies and Usage 

## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis focuses on analyzing a single variable at a time, examining its distribution, central tendency, variability, and other descriptive statistics. It aims to understand the characteristics and properties of that variable without considering relationships with other variables.
### CountPlot
A count plot is a type of data visualization that shows the **frequency** of **observations** in **categorical data**. It's used in univariate analysis to quickly understand the **distribution of categories within a single variable**, helping to identify common or rare categories and their relative frequencies.
### Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It divides the data into intervals called bins and displays the frequency of observations within each bin as bars. In univariate analysis, histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single variable, providing insights into its central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and presence of outliers.
### DistPlot
A distplot, short for distribution plot, is a type of data visualization that combines a histogram with a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot. It displays the distribution of numerical data and provides an estimate of the probability density function of the variable. 
### BoxPlot
A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a statistical visualization that shows the distribution of numerical data based on quartiles. It consists of a box that represents the interquartile range (IQR), with a line inside denoting the median. Whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data excluding outliers.
